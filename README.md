# Sensirion SEN6x

## ===========================================================

A program to set instructions and get information from an SEN6x. It has been
tested to run I2C communication on UNOR4 Wifi

<br> A detailed description of the findings are in SEN6x.odt

## Getting Started
As part of a larger project I am looking at analyzing and understanding the air quality.
I have done a number of projects on air-sensors. This is a version of a working driver + examples.
More work continues to happen to create examples and compare against other sensors.

## Prerequisites
Examples 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40 have a dependency on other libraries and hardware. Documented in sketch.

## Software installation
Obtain the zip and install like any other.

## Program usage
Install like any other external library

### Program options
See the description in the top of the sketch and read the documentation (odt)
